#### Sample Report

This report is created about monthly and needed by Joan Redwing and Kevin Dressler as an overview if LiST is up to date. The following [Excel](https://pennstateoffice365.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/2DCC-DataManagement/Shared%20Documents/Data%20Management/Reporting/Sample%20Report%202022-01-28.xlsx) contains a sheet for the current data and one for comparison, usually one month back.

Data is gathered via the following [SQL](https://pennstateoffice365.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/2DCC-DataManagement/Shared%20Documents/Data%20Management/Reporting/Report%20SQL/Reporting%20Scripts/Reporting%20Scripts/CharacterizationReport.sql). Execution of that script pretty slow (takes several minutes when done via VPN).

For the moment, I update the excel file manually, so that I can mark research groups etc.
