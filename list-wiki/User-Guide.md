#### Projects

Projects are used to group samples. All samples in LiST have to associated to a project, so whenever a sample is created in LiST, a project has to be chosen. A sample can be transferred to another project later. The project also determines who can see and modify samples.

For User Projects, project documents like proposals or reviews are tacked in LiST using Project Activities.

#### Data Packages

LiST offers two ways to publish samples, by project, or by dedicated data packages. When a project is set to public, all containing samples will be publicly available. Data packages are used to publish a set of samples, which can also be linked to a publication.

#### Bulk View

To facilitate working with growth runs with several samples and samples that are prepared before growth instrument or date are known, a dedicated User Interface for the Bulk Research Group has been developed. It is accessible when a bulk researcher or faculty is connected to LiST.
