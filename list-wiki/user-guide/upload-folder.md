## Uploading Characterization Data

### Via the web browser

### Upload Folder

Characterization Data can be uploaded to LiST by placing the files in the 
[Upload Folder on Box](https://psu.app.box.com/folder/7847510663)

- If you use Box Sync, you can just copy files there. 
- LiST is reading this folder and moving the files to the samples.
- Samples still have to be added to LIST before.
- Characterization activities are created automatically but not submitted. So you have the possibility to review (and correct) the uploaded data before submitting it.

The upload folder contains a sub folder per characterization instrument. 
Characterization files should be placed in a folder named after the Sample ID.
This could look like this:

LiST Upload
+ XRD1 - PANalytical XPert Pro MPD
   + MBE2-190412C-MH
      +  MBE2-190412C-MH_Reflectivity2.xrdml
      +  â€¦

#### File Upload Records

LiST keeps a record for all files in the upload folder.

It shows all files put in the upload folder, and which files could not be processed.

Entries in this table are kept for 30 days, errors are kept until they are deleted.

When LiST cannot identify a sample, files get moved to the ErrorFolder (Subfolder of the Upload folder).
If it was just a sample that did not exist at the time of uploading, you can move the files back into the Upload folder after creating the sample.
