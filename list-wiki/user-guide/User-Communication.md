## User Communication

All relevant project data should be available in LiST. Emails and records of phone or video calls can be added to the "Communications" section of user projects

Each entry captures:
* Date the communication occurred
* Participants (for phone/video calls)
* Content field (copy/paste emails or records)
* Files can be attached as well

### Modify or delete communications

Communication entries, like notes, can always be modified or deleted by the collaborator who created them.
Any newly added communication entry is in edit mode, when opening the project at a later time, it will be shown as submitted and not be editable.

Communication entries, however, can always be reset to pending via the button "Reset status" in the footer

This can be done by the collaborator who created them or an admin. After resetting the status to pending, all fields can be modified, files and also the whole communication entry can be deleted.
