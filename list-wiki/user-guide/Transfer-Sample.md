# Transfer samples to other projects

It is not uncommon that samples are originally grown on a in-house project, but later shipped to a user. 
For NSF reporting, 2DCC has to distinguish instrument time for in-house research and for external users.
By transferring samples to the user project, instrument time for that particular sample can then be counted towards external research.

Samples can be transferred even when they have already been submitted. 

There are two ways to record a transfer. A sample can simply be moved to another project, without recording where it has originally been grown. If the whole sample is transferred from an internal project to a user project, that is the preferred way.

When a sample has been split and only some pieces are transferred, or when a sample grown on a user project is transferred elsewhere, LiST keeps track of the transfer by adding a transfer activity, registering the original and target project.

Both kinds of transfer are initiated via the context menu of the sample that is to be transferred.

The target project ID can be entered in the "To Project" field or the project can be selected from a list of projects.
If the check box "Do not keep transfer activity" is deselected, the sample will be simply moved, otherwise, a transfer activity is added.

The check box "Show target project" can be selected to show the same sample on the new project after the transfer is saved.
If it is deselected, the original will be shown afterwards.
