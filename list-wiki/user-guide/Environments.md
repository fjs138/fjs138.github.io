# Environments
We have a testing environment where new version of LiST will be installed first. 
The testing environment is accessible [here](https://m4-2dcc-testing.vmhost.psu.edu/list).

There is marker when working on the Testing Environment:\

Customizing data might not always be up to date on the testing system. More recent projects or instruments are probably not available.

The production environment is accessible [here](https://m4-2dcc.vmhost.psu.edu/list).
