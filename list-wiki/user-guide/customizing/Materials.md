The menu point "Materials" contains different element depending on synthesis techniques used by the current user.
There are the following entries:

## Materials
All materials used in LiST are available here. It is possible to add new materials or to modify the label shown in description fields and publication lists (with subscript number). Adding materials is also possible in all places they are used in LiST:
* Project
* Sample
* Synthesis and Preparation Activities
Materials added at those places will show up in this table, too, and can be modified here.

The label is generated automatically, this is normal HTML usually with `<sub>` tags for subscript numbers. If the generated label is not correct, is can be corrected manually.

## Substrates
The substrate table is only available for Thin Film Research Groups.
Substrates are used to record which specific instance of a material had been used to grow a sample.
For each substrate, a Material has to be selected and vendor, lot, orientation and purity can be added. The latter are all optional fields.

The last column indicates if and by how many samples a substrate / raw material is used. Deleting is only possible if a substrate is not used at all.

### Techniques
The technique column allows to mark a substrate as relevant to only certain techniques. It will not be proposed for samples using another growth techniques.

## Raw Materials
The raw material table is only available for the Bulk Groups.
Similar to substrates, raw materials are used to record the origin of all substances used to prepare a bulk sample.
A material has to be selected, the fields vendor, lot, purity and granularity are optional.
It is also possible to add the molar weight for all new materials directly in the "Raw Materials" Table.

Raw materials are categorized by the intended grow method which is chosen via a drop down. 
* Compounding  
  Used to mix powders that are then compounded for CVT or Bridgeman or used for Melt Growth or Flux Growth
* CVT  
  Transport Agents used for CVT
* Floating Zone  
  Materials used for Floating Zone Rods.



## Molar Weight
For Bulk growth, the molar weight has to be known for all raw materials used. A dedicated table is used to record molar weights of all raw materials. It is also possible to add the molar weight for all new materials directly in the "Raw Materials" Table.
