# Projects in LiST

Projects are used to group samples. All samples in LiST have to associated to a project,
so whenever a sample is created in LiST, a project has to be chosen.  
A sample can be transferred to another project later.

The project also determines who can see and modify samples. When a project is created, researchers and faculty are assigned to the project. Only those people can add or modify samples. All projects are visible (in readonly mode) to all 2DCC personnel, though.

User projects (which can be Sample Projects or Research Projects) are added to LiST by Kevin Dressler when they are approved.
Kevin also assigns faculty and researchers to a project. Once created, User Projects can be updated by the assigned faculty.

In-House projects can be created by Faculty and Instrument managers.

### Project Activities
For User Projects, project documents are added to LiST in form of [Project Activities](user-guide/project-activities).

### Projects assigned to you
When connection to LiST, you see a list of all projects assigned to you. When working with a project, you can open this list of all assigned projects by clicking on "Choose Project".

The checkbox "Only my projects" can be unchecked in order to see all projects. All other projects where you are not a collaborator will be read only.

### Projects with sample requests
For Sample projects, the samples 2DCC agreed to provide are added to LiST as Sample Requests.
The tab "Sample Request" shows a list of all samples due. It is possible to assign a due date to sample requests, this allows ordering this list by due date.

Sample requests are shown in the project view, on a separate tab. Project Collaborators can add sample requests or modify existing requests, e.g. add comments or modify the status. When the status is set to shipped, the sample request will no longer be shown in the "my sample requests" list and the number of samples due for the project will be updated.

When a shipping is prepared in LiST, sample requests can be [associated with it](user-guide/Ship-Samples).
Those sample requests are then updated automatically to "Shipped" or "In Process" once the shipping is completed.

### Create a Project
New Projects can only be created by faculty or instrument managers. This is done via an entry in the main menu

Other than most data, projects are not saved automatically initially. Depending on the project type and material, LiST proposed a Project ID that cannot be modified afterwards, so the project has to be saved by clicking the Save button.
(Modifying the Project ID is possible, but currently only be an Administrator)

### User Settings: Show the recent project or the list of assigned projects
Whether the List of all assigned projects shall opened after connecting to LiST is configurable. 
The User Settings Menu contains a setting that allows switching to showing the recently used project.
