## Working as Admin

Certain tasks in LiST require Admin privileges, for instance resetting the status of submit objects, or adding users.

`Admin` is not a role that is assigned to users, but a flag that allows certain users to switch into the admin role, regardless of what their normal role is. 
When such a user signs into LiST, they will be signed in with their regular role, and have to switch into the admin role if they need to perform tasks that require this. 

This can be done (only by users that are allowed to work as admin) in the User menu:\

## Sign in as someone else

Signing in using as someone else is a privilege that can be assigned to user roles. Admins have all privileges, so they can always sign in as someone else (but might have to switch to the admin role first).

This allows viewing LiST like another user would see it, and for instance check if that user has access to certain data.
