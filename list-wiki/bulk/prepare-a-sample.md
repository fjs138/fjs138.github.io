* Choose a project (the button ![image]\(/list-wiki//uploads/146618585a393694642735b6f06a218a/image.png) opens a list of all assigned projects) or enter the project ID and modify the growth date if necessary (today by default). Th Sample ID will be generated, using the first letters of first and last name + a unique number (e.g. SL0071\)

*  Select the method
  * Choose "Prepare Raw Materials for Compounding" to prepare a sample in an ampoule that will be compounded (for CVT or Bridgman) or grown using Flux or Melt Growth.
  * "Raw materials and transport agent" is used when both materials and CVT transport agent are introduced at the same time.
  * "Prepare Raw Material Rod for Floating Zone" allows to record both the composition and the preparation process to form rod. If this method is used, samples will be listed as "Prepared for Floating Zone" and only that Growth Method can be used.

* Click "Add Sample". A new line will be added:

1. Choose a material.  
2. (If it is not yet in LiST, it can be added here by using the Entry "-- Add New--").
3. Choose the raw materials. 
4. (If it is not yet in LiST, it can be added here by using the Entry "-- Add New--").
4. Fill the Amount-of-matter column with the composition.  
5. Enter the desired total mass.  
  The element and the molar weight column will be updated automatically. The mass for each raw material will be calculated,
  the column "Mass (actual)" will be updated with the same number and allows an adjustment to the measured weight.
  LiST maintains a list of all molar weights in the [customizing section](user-guide/customizing/materials). If there is a raw material missing or the molar weight is not available, it can be added or updated there. 
7. Enter the further preparation details.
8. A comment can be added, but it is not necessary to double any information of recipe itself, like the composition.
9. Save the recipe

## Copy the composition of existing samples
* Select one or several samples in the table. Those can be samples that have only been prepared or samples that have been grown.
* Select "Copy Sample Preparation" from the Main Menu (or use the Context Menu).
